You need PHP-5.2+ installed. Run:

$ phpize
$ ./configure --enable-ixp
$ make
$ make install

(You might need root privileges for the last step).
Enable the extension by adding the line:

extension=ixp.so

in your php.ini. You can verify that the extension has been loaded:

$ php -m | grep ixp

Enjoy!
